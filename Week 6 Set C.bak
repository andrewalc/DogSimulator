;; A SimulationState is a structure: 
;; (make-fs FSM FSM-State)
   (define-struct fs [fsm current])
;; INTERPRETATION: fsm is an FSM.
;;                 current is the current FSM-State.


;; A Transition is a structure:
;; (make-transition FSM-State FSM-State)
   (define-struct transition [current next])
;; INTERPRETATION: current is the current FSM-State.
;;                 next is what will be the next FSM-State.

;; FSM-State is a Color.

;; A Color is one of:
;; — "white"
;; — "yellow"
;; — "orange"
;; — "green"
;; — "red"
;; — "blue"
;; — "black"
;; — ...
;; Note: DrRacket recognizes many more strings as colors.

;; A FSM is one of:
;;   – '()
;;   – (cons Transition FSM)

;; INTERPRETATION: A FSM represents the transitions that a finite
;;                 state machine  can take from one state to another
;;                 in reaction to key strokes.
